# Use-Cases
A home for Polder use cases.

Please use this repository to propose, discuss and approve Use Cases for implementation by the Polar Data Enhancement Research group [Polder] (https://polder.info).  The purpose of the POLDER group is ultimately to finally implement the community's decades long time goal of single-window metadata search across polar science and research communities.
